# Vision and Goals

## Vision Statement

Ragnetic is the simplest, most beautiful, fully self-hosted RAG knowledge platform. Deploy in 5 minutes. Own your data. No vendor lock-in. Enterprise-ready from day one.

The enterprise knowledge management market is shifting: organizations want private, controllable AI that reasons over proprietary data without sending it to third-party cloud APIs. Current open-source options force a tradeoff—either high complexity (e.g. Casibase, LangChain) or toy-grade simplicity (e.g. Open-Notebook, basic Streamlit demos). Ragnetic targets the gap: an enterprise-grade, privacy-first RAG platform that a solo developer can deploy in minutes and that enterprises can trust in production.

## Target Dimensions

| Dimension | Current market norm | Ragnetic target |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------|
| Time to first query | 2–8 hours setup | &lt; 5 minutes (Docker) |
| User experience | CLI or basic UI | Polished, intuitive dashboard |
| Data sources | 1–2 manually | 10+ auto-ingested connectors |
| Multi-user support | None or paid-only | Built-in RBAC, free and open |
| Documentation | Sparse / outdated | 10x better, with video guides |
| Deployment | Complex configs | Single `docker-compose up` |

## Goals

- **Simplicity + power:** 5-minute Docker deploy with enterprise-grade features.
- **Documentation-first:** Invest in docs, tutorials, architecture guides, and contribution guidelines.
- **Beautiful UX:** Polished Next.js dashboard that non-technical users can adopt.
- **Multi-source ingestion:** PDFs, Confluence, Slack, GitHub, emails, Notion supported from the start.
